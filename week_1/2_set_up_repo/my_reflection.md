## 2. [Open Source and Repo Setup](2_set_up_repo/readme.md) Reflection

* Explain how to create a repository on GitHub and clone the repository to your local computer to a non-technical person
* Describe what open source means
* What do you think about Open Source? Does it make you nervous or protective? Does it feel like utopia?
* Assess the importance of using licenses
* What concepts were solidified in the challenge? Did you have any "aha" moments? What did you struggle with?
* Did you find any resources on your own that helped you better understand a topic? If so, please list it.

To create a Github repository sign in to Github and then click the '+' button in the top right portion of the screen to reveal the dropdown menu. Click "New Repository." Then you will have to name your repository. You can add an optional description, which is recommended for keeping track of everything. To use this repo on your computer you will want to download the GitHub app onto your computer. Follow the set up instructions. Once the application is open, click on your username on the left hand side of the window. If you don't see your repo, in the search feild search for what you named your repo. When you find it click "clone to computer". Do a happy dance!

Open source means that the source code, or the code that makes the program work, is freely shared to the public.

I think open source is an amazing development that lends itself to the better side of human nature, the desire to contribute and share and be helpful to the community at large. It makes a lot of sense for programming, because the more people contribute, the more everyone benefits, including the initial contributer. However, I don't beleive it is utopian. In the real world people do still need to make money to live. Some open source projects result in people working tremendously hard on something and getting no monetary compensation, while someone else takes from that hard work and profits hugely. Of course as long as this is voluntary there isn't really a problem. But to me a more perfect system would allow for free and open sharing, but if someone's idea is used to make a huge ammount of money, they would get money somehow. I don't know what that would be, however, and I think the open source movement is tremendously positive.

Licenses are important because if you make a contribution, you at least want to get the credit. Also, if you liscense something first, someone else cannot put their own restrictive liscence on it. If you create a clever problem solving block of code and don't licensce it, you could end up in a situation where someone else steals it, copywrites it, and then sues you for using your own code.

No new "aha" moments on this one. I have used GitHub and read up much about Open Source in the past. However, I was reminded of how easy GitHub makes it for users to licence their code, which is a really amazing resource.

I have used other resources to understand open source and GitHub, but I don't remember what they were, so I guess nothing stuck out.
