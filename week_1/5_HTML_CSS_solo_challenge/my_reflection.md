I asked a few questions during this challenge including how to get rid of the three symbols that kept popping up on the page and how to get my image to fit within the div. I found the answers to both on Stack Overflow. 

I'm having a little trouble with getting the layout to look how I want it to in general, but its been a while since I used HTML and CSS. 

I learned how to save my file on Sublime Text so the symbols don't show up. 

I'm very confident in HTML tags and medium confident with positioning in CSS. I get the concepts, but its not exactly flowing naturally in the way I would like. Practice practice practice!

I enjoyed the whole thing once I got into a rythym. 

I find getting CSS perfect so it looks how I want to be quite tedious.
