## 6. [Wireframing](6_wireframing/readme.md) Reflection

* * What did you learn about design and user experience? 
* Do you like design and user experience? Was it fun working on your site, the plan, and/or the wireframe? (If you hated it, that's OK too)

* What questions did you ask during this challnge? What resources did you find to help you answer them?  
* What concepts are you having trouble with, or did you just figure something out? If so, what?  
* Did you learn any new skills or tricks?
* How confident are you with each of the Learning Competencies for this challenge? 
* Which parts of the challenge did you enjoy?
* Which parts of the challenge did you find tedious?

I learned that design is a way of thinking and a method for problem solving!

I have mixed feelings about design. I have felt in the past that I'm not good at it, but I don't really know why I think that. I had fun at times, but I always have at least some fun learning something new. 

During the challenge I had many questions about wireframing, like "What's the point really?" Working with Gannon was very helpful because he has experience doing design and wireframing specifically. I see now that it is very useful. Coding is its own challenge, and if you are not worrying about creating the design, but only implementing it, it will be easier. 

I'm still a little shaky on what design thinking is. I understand the words, but with some experience I think I'll get it a lot better. 

I learned how to wireframe using Balsamiq, and I enjoy that tool.

I feel very confident in my ability to explain Wireframing, why it is useful, and wireframing a website. 

I enjoyed making my web page with the screenshots of the wireframe. After brushing up on HTML in the last few excercizes this one was a breeze. I also enjoyed wireframing on Balsamiq.

I didn't find anything particularly tedious on this one. :)
