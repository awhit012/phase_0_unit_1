## 8. [Comparing Favorite Websites](8_technical_blog/readme.md) Reflection

Blog url: <!-- Blog URL here (remove comment)  -->

Reflect on the process of researching and writing a blog post. It doesn't have to be long. Did you enjoy this? Did you get comments or views? Did you find the blog helpful to your learning? Did you find it cumbersome? Which parts did you feel best about and which did you feel less certain about?

I did enjoy this some, but it felt the most like homework of the excersizes so far. I enjoyed setting it up and laying it out, but writing the comment was not my favorite. I understand that design is of upmost importance and you can't have a good product without good design, however it is near the bottom of my personal interests in web development. My passion is websites that provide a disruptive, innovative service. I am less certain about what is really important about design. For example, on Puddle.com it is imperitive that the user interface be elegant and simple, which they do a great job at. However, another one of my favorite sites is Reddit.com, which is much more cluttered and has much much more content. They handle this by having powerful sorting tools (which makes Reddit one of the most powerful tools on the web.) I feel like I did learn about design just by the excercize of describing it.
