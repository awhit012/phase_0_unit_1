Take a moment to reflect on reading other people's responses regarding their fears about DBC. How did that make you feel? Did you feel better, worse, or something else all together? How has your experience this week influenced your feelings? All feelings are welcome and ok. Just take a moment to think about it and write it down.

I’d love to work for these guys: www.puddle.com

Learning Style: Aural and tactile aka listening and doing. I like to listen to an expert explain something really well, then forget all I just learned and dive in. I also talk to myself a lot when I’m thinking.

I haven't found where you we put our fears. So far my fears are of burning out. So far this week has made me feel mostly better. I like that we get background for all elements of what we are learning with links to many great resources.
